        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am originally from the Philippines. My maternal grandmother had me petitioned to move and live here in America, for better opportunities and to broaden my horizons.I moved when I was 20 years old and the only English I knew was from books. I wasn't aware that speaking it would be so different from learning it.</p>
        <p>To me, learning a new language is <em>fascinating</em>. And that is one of the many reasons why I have chosen to take this course.</p>
        <p>I have been in different jobs and in different places. I have listed my professional experience in order, starting from my very first job at 17 years old up to now.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Telemarketer at one of the local branches of a National FastFood Restaurant Chain</li>
          <li>Janitor at Taco Bell in Fresno, California when I first moved here in the U.S., and couldn't speak or understand conversational English.</li>
          <li>In Home Nanny (this is the time that I started really teaching myself how to speak without or at least, with a lot less Filipino accent) in San Bernardino, California.</li>
          <li>Joined the U.S. Military for a short time, Army branch. I worked as an Administrative Assistant, in several different posts.</li>
          <li>Certified Nurse Assistant and Home Health Aide.</li>
          <li>Restorative Nurse Assistant where I worked closely with Physical and Occupational Therapists</li>
          <li>Surgical Nurse Assistant at Fresno Heart Hospital.</li>
          <li>Hospice Nurse Assistant in Fresno, California.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>After a major car accident: I moved here in Portland Oregon to start anew, and found a job as a Barista. I also found employment in the retail industry, in different positions. Currently, I am not working and just focusing in school.</p>
