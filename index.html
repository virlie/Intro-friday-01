        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Graduated in Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education majored in English Literature and minor in Arts, in the Philippines, my maternal grandmother had me petitioned to move and live here in America, for better opportunities and to broaden my horizons.I moved when I was 20 years old and the only English I knew was from books. I wasn't aware that speaking it would be so different from learning it.</p>
        <p>To me, learning a new language is <em>fascinating</em>. And that is one of the many reasons why I have chosen to take this course.</p>
        <p>I have been in different jobs and in different places so far in my lifetime. I have listed my professional experience in order, starting from my very first job at 17 years old up to now.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Telemarketer at one of the local branches of a National FastFood Restaurant Chain</li>
          <li>Janitor at Taco Bell in Fresno, California when I first moved here in the U.S., and couldn't speak or understand conversational English.</li>
          <li>In Home Nanny (this is the time that I started really teaching myself how to speak without or at least, with a lot less Filipino accent) in San Bernardino, California.</li>
          <li>Joined the U.S. Military for four years, Army branch. I worked as an Administrative Assistant, in several different posts.</li>
          <li>Certified Nurse Assistant and Home Health Aide.</li>
